## Overview
This app was developed during Facebook University, on the Android track, during the summer of 2021. Sound City is an app where users can connect to their Spotify and share music with their friends. They can discover new music through their friends' posts, and they can see directly what their friends are listening to.

### Description
Sound City is a music sharing app where users can users can connect to Spotify and share their playlists, top songs of the month, and even their currently playing song. They can play a song or playlist from a post in the app, and when they click on another userâ€™s profile, they can view their compatibility score with them, calculated based on how similar their details are.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Social Media
- **Mobile:** User can see real-time info on what their following is listening to
- **Story:** Creates a sense of community with music; users can explore new music seeing what their friends are listening to
- **Market:** Casual music listeners to music lovers; anyone can use the app
- **Habit:** Users will be able to check the app as often as they want to see what their friends are listening to. Users can also check the app when they want to listen and find new music. 
- **Scope:** Simplest version would be where users can create a profile, post their music, and see other users' timelines. Could be tested with a very small group of users. V2 would allow more customization of users' profiles, and allow users to find new people easily.
