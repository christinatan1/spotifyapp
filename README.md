## Overview
Music sharing app that allows users to create a profile and share music they enjoy with their friends, as well as see what their friends are listening to.

### Description
Allows people using the app to share their music with their follows and see music that people they follow post. Users can customize their profile with emojis and music, as well as display their most recently played song. They can also start a collaborative music session with their friends to listen to music together. Upon entering the app, users will be taken to the login page, where they will be prompted to create an account and profile.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Social Media
- **Mobile:** User can see real-time info on what their following is listening to
- **Story:** Creates a sense of community with music; users can explore new music seeing what their friends are listening to
- **Market:** Casual music listeners to music lovers; anyone can use the app
- **Habit:** Users will be able to check the app as often as they want to see what their friends are listening to. Users can also check the app when they want to listen and find new music. 
- **Scope:** Simplest version would be where users can create a profile, post their music, and see other users' timelines. Could be tested with a very small group of users. V2 would allow more customization of users' profiles, and allow users to find new people easily.
